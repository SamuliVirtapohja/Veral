# Veral

Veral (the current name of course) is game project currently being developed to pcs. It's still work in progress as the devs are pretty much learning how to do things.

Music will be done mostly (unless we get more people on the project) by Dreamencost.

Story is not yet set in, we got couple people in our radar that would be awesome addition to the storytelling.

Programming is currently being worked by Gromathos and Caruha.
